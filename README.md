# Introduction
## Problem

After Covid-19, online course becames an alternative for many universities and instituts.
I learnt Russian language for 1 year (2020) and I started university courses on the following years.
the big problem that I had to overcome was to find best wqy to increase my vocabulary and practice.

<Strong>How to write words that you never listen and that you don't know the meaning?</Strong>

## Idea
I used a simple combination of microphone and headphone to solve the problem temporarly. The headphone was attached to my computer and the microphone to my phone.
On that way, the sound from computer was transmitted to the traductor on my phone.

This method was useful for me but the room noise sometime distrubed transcription. 
the unique way to solve that problem was to directly listen sound from computer to a translator.

So I decided to create an internal application which directly listens sound, transcripts and translates it.
