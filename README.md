# Introduction
## Problem

After Covid-19, online course becames an alternative for many universities and instituts.
I learnt Russian language for 1 year (2020) and I started university courses on the following year.
The big problem that I had to overcome was to find a best way to increase my vocabulary.

<Strong>How to write words that you never listen and that you don't know the meaning?</Strong>

## Idea
I used a simple combination of microphone and headphone to solve this problem temporarly. The headphone was attached to my computer and the microphone to my phone.
On that way, the sound from computer was transmitted to the translator on my phone.

This method was useful for me but the noise from the room sometime distrubed the transcription and I needed to click each time to the phone to active listening.
The unique way to solve that problem was to directly listen the sound from computer to a translator.

So I decided to create an internal application which directly listens sound, transcripts and translates it.

Simple as an applicaiton, you just need to click to the microphone and wait for the transcription of any sound from computer.
